# ?

? is a marking website for thingies you have done.

You can mark:

* The book you have read.
* The movie you have watched.
* The album you have listened.
* The game you have played.
* The place you have visited.
* etc...

## History

I was a [Douban](https://douban.com) dead-loving user (and even former employee).
Unfortunately, I was not able to use it because of many reasons, such as being
reluctant to provide my phone number, data hosted in China, strict censorship, etc.
After years' frustration without a good replacement, I re-designed and developed
a new website named Markdone.

## Fees

You'll need to pay $11 USD a year. It will cover the cost of servers,
cloud services, and my time. You payment will help keeping the site run as long as
possible. You'll see no ads at all because this site is fully supported by all
users' payments.

Honestly speaking, you can mark books, movies, albums, games in different websites
for free. However, some of them belongs to big companies and harvest your
data; some of them have too many other fancy features;
some of them send your information to third-parties for displaying ads or
do something evil; and some of them provides just one or two types of things
? supports. If you don't like these, choose ?.

## Technology

? is written in Python.
The site's data is stored in a MySQL database.
Redis is used as the cache and the queue.
A few servers run on different US regions for the sake of high availability.
No container, no kubernetes, just boring technology for sane people (me).
