# MarkSthFun

MarkSthFun (<https://marksth.fun>) is a marking website for fun and tasty thingies.
(Pronounce it as "Mark Something Fun".)

You can mark:

* The books you have read.

* The albums you have listened.
* The games you have played.
* The places you have visited.
* The software you have used.
* The papers you have read.
* The concepts you have learned.
* etc.

You can write notes for your marks and manage things by tags.
You can decide whether to share your things publicly or not.
You can discover fun things marked by fun people, of course, if they're willing to share.

The site is developed and operated by a one-person team.

Honestly speaking, you can mark books, movies, albums, games in different websites
for free. However, some of them belongs to big companies and harvest your
data; some of them have too many other fancy features;
some of them send your information to third-parties for displaying ads or
do something evil; and some of them provide just one or two types of things
[marksth.fun](https://marksth.fun) supports.

## Technology
