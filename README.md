# MarkSthFun

MarkSthFun (<https://marksth.fun>) is a marking website for fun and tasty thingies.
(Pronounce it as "Mark Something Fun".)

You can mark:

* The books you have read.
* The movies you have watched.
* The albums you have listened.
* The games you have played.
* The places you have visited.
* The software you have used.
* The papers you have read.
* The concepts you have learned.
* etc.

You can write notes for your marks and manage things by tags.

You can decide whether to share your things publicly or not.

You can discover fun things marked by fun people, of course, if they're willing to share.

## Fees

You'll need to pay $12 USD a year. It will cover the cost of web servers,
database backup, domains, cloud services, and last but not least, my time.
You payment will help keeping the site run as long as possible.
You'll see no ads at all because this site is fully supported by all
users' payments. You'll see where the money goes [here].

Honestly speaking, you can mark books, movies, albums, games in different websites
for free. However, some of them belongs to big companies and harvest your
data; some of them have too many other fancy features;
some of them send your information to third-parties for displaying ads or
do something evil; and some of them provide just one or two types of things
<marksth.fun> supports.

## History

I was a [Douban](https://douban.com) dead-loving user (and even a former employee).
Unfortunately, I was not able to use it because of many reasons, such as being
reluctant to provide my phone number, data hosted in China, strict censorship, etc.
After years' frustration without a good replacement, I re-designed and developed
a new website named MarkSthFun.

## Technology

MarkSthFun is written in Python.
The site's data is stored in a MySQL database.
Redis is used as the cache and the queue.
A few servers run on different US regions for the sake of high availability.
No kubernetes, no big data, no machine learning, just boring technology for sane people (me).
