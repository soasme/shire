    <h2>What is {{ config.SITE_NAME }}?</h2>
    <p>
      {{ config.SITE_NAME }} is a marking website for thingies in your life. Marking is way more important than socializing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can mark the books you have read, the movies you have watched, the albums you have listened,
      the games you have played, the places you have visited, etc. Check out how other users have played around with this site: <a href="/recent/">recent</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    It has no ads. It never adds third-party tracking. It doesn't store your search history. You pay ${{ config.ANNUAL_FEE }} per year to get rid of data harvesting from big companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has as few images as possible to avoid you from being tracked by other websites. It secures your connections via HTTPS to avoid you from being tampered by malicious parties.
