## 2019

In 2019, Ju Lin began work on MarkSthFun (<https://marksth.fun>) as a side project. The site
was running on Heroku for the first three month under the free tier. The only users were his beloved wife and himself at the time. You can actually still access this [site](https://heyfrodo.herokuapp.com/).
