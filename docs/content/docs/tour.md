This is a tour guide of MarkSthFun <https://marksth.fun>.

## Why MarkSthFun?

* It's fast, even when you have over tens of thousands of marks and tags.
* It's highly available; the SLA level is subject to 99.9% availability.

* You can add up to 100 tags per mark.
* You can discover fun people and their tags by subscribing their RSS feeds!
* You can find those people who are of the same interest quickly.
* You can import and export your data instantly.
<!-- TODO * You can delete your account if you don't want to stay. All your data will be erased completely. -->
<!-- TODO * The site provides multiple levels of privacy control, such as private account, private mark, private tag, and private note. -->
<!-- TODO * The site offers RESTful APIs and encourages third-party extensions. -->
* The site follows a minimalist design. Marking is way more important than socializing.
* There is always a dedicated maintainer (me) who is striving to answer your questions.
* The price is reasonable, $1 per month.
* You can use the site for free for the next year if you invite a new user.

## Why Not MarkSthFun?

* You prefer marking different types of things in different websites.
* You don't worry your browsing history and personal information being sold/shared by [some companies](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45976300).
* You don't want to host your data in anybody's server. (In that case, you can choose not using <https://marksth.fun> but instead deploying a instance of MarkSthFun from source code.)

## Marks

A mark has a category, a title, an optional url, and some optional tags.
You can also add some notes to your marks.

When no url is provided, a duckduckgo searching link will be attached. (We trust duckduckgo, because it won't sell your data to third-parties.)

## Privacy

We recommend you setting up your privacy properly.

<!-- TODO In your account settings page, you can convert your account to *private* at any time. No marks within a privacy account will be shared publicly, even when the mark is shared. -->

The marks that are unshared are invisible to other users. Private marks have a lock icon displayed. The browser will remember your share setting for marks in your local. Note that when switching device or cleaning cookies will reset your share setting for marks.

MarkSthFun doesn't show any images or run scripts from the mark url and your notes. This strategy is effective in avoiding privacy leaks and being stalked by analytics trackers.

MarkSthFun requires no additional personal information except a working email address for sending invoice and lost-password emails.

## Read Later

Sometimes, you discover an interesting person, or an interesting thing, or an interesting tag. You can connect your ReadItLater/Pocket account to save it.

## Tags

You can organize your marks by adding tags.
You can filter your marks by tags.
You can add a period to the tag to make it private, such as ".private", ".OnlyMeCanSeeIt".

For example, this [list](https://marksth.fun/u/soasme/t/marksthfun-stack/) contains technology stack that MarkSthFun uses.

## Feeds

MarkSthFun provides RSS feeds on some pages. Search "RSS" on the page if there is one.
You can add the feed to your RSS readers.

## Responsive

The site is optimized on mobile devices so that it looks good on small screens.

## Discover

Despite of the less importance of socializing, some people shares their marks.

You can find the most [recent](https://markth.fun/recent/) marks on the site.

You can also click the "similar marks" on each mark.

The global tag pages provide you all public bookmarks for each public tag.
