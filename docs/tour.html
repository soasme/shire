<h2>Why MarkSthFun?</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's fast, even when you have over tens of thousands of marks and tags.</li>
<li>It's highly available; the SLA level is subject to 99.9% availability.</li>
<li>You can mark things in over dozens of categories. Most other websites only supports one or two per site.</li>
<li>You can add up to 100 tags per mark.</li>
<li>You can discover fun people and their tags by subscribing their RSS feeds!</li>
<li>You can find those people who are of the same interest quickly.</li>
<li>You can import and export your data instantly.
<!-- TODO * You can delete your account if you don't want to stay. All your data will be erased completely. -->
<!-- TODO * The site provides multiple levels of privacy control, such as private account, private mark, private tag, and private note. -->
<!-- TODO * The site offers RESTful APIs and encourages third-party extensions. --></li>
<li>The site follows a minimalist design. Marking is way more important than socializing.</li>
<li>There is always a dedicated maintainer (me) who is striving to answer your questions.</li>
<li>The price is reasonable, $1 per month.</li>
<li>You can use the site for free for the next year if you invite a new user.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Not MarkSthFun?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You prefer marking different types of things in different websites.</li>
<li>You don't worry your browsing history and personal information being sold/shared by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45976300">some companies</a>.</li>
<li>You don't want to host your data in anybody's server. (In that case, you can choose not using <a href="https://marksth.fun">https://marksth.fun</a> but instead deploying a instance of MarkSthFun from source code.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marks</h2>
<p>A mark has a category, a title, an optional url, and some optional tags.
You can also add some notes to your marks.</p>
<p>When no url is provided, a duckduckgo searching link will be attached. (We trust duckduckgo, because it won't sell your data to third-parties.)</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>We recommend you setting up your privacy properly.</p>
<!-- TODO In your account settings page, you can convert your account to *private* at any time. No marks within a privacy account will be shared publicly, even when the mark is shared. -->

<p>The marks that are unshared are invisible to other users. Private marks have a lock icon displayed. The browser will remember your share setting for marks in your local. Note that when switching device or cleaning cookies will reset your share setting for marks.</p>
<p>MarkSthFun doesn't show any images or run scripts from the mark url and your notes. This strategy is effective in avoiding privacy leaks and being stalked by analytics trackers.</p>
<p>MarkSthFun requires no additional personal information except a working email address for sending invoice and lost-password emails.</p>
<h2>Read Later</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you discover an interesting person, or an interesting thing, or an interesting tag. You can connect your ReadItLater/Pocket account to save it.</p>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>You can organize your marks by adding tags.
You can filter your marks by tags.
You can add a period to the tag to make it private, such as ".private", ".OnlyMeCanSeeIt".</p>
<p>For example, this <a href="https://marksth.fun/u/soasme/t/marksthfun-stack/">list</a> contains technology stack that MarkSthFun uses.</p>
<h2>Feeds</h2>
<p>MarkSthFun provides RSS feeds on some pages. Search "RSS" on the page if there is one.
You can add the feed to your RSS readers.</p>
<h2>Responsive</h2>
<p>The site is optimized on mobile devices so that it looks good on small screens.</p>
<h2>Discover</h2>
<p>Despite of the less importance of socializing, some people shares their marks.</p>
<p>You can find the most <a href="https://markth.fun/recent/">recent</a> marks on the site.</p>
<p>You can also click the "similar marks" on each mark.</p>
<p>The global tag pages provide you all public bookmarks for each public tag.</p>
